Do you like the idea of [GitHub's Project Automation feature](https://github.com/blog/2458-keep-your-project-boards-up-to-date-automatically) but find it lacking?

This bot will **automatically** _add_ new Issues or Pull Requests to a Project board based on specially formatted Cards in each Column of a Project. It also allows you to customize the rules for _moving_ Issues between Columns.


## Installation

Go to the [project-bot GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/project-bot) page and click `[Install]` (or `[Configure]` if you already installed it) to have it run on **Public** Project Boards.

To see what it looks like, you can look at the [GitHub projects for this repository](https://github.com/philschatz/project-bot/projects).


## Example

To create an Automation Card, create a Card in a Project like this:

```md
###### Automation Rules

<!-- Documentation: https://github.com/philschatz/project-bot -->

- `assigned_issue`
- `closed_issue`
- `added_label` **wontfix**
- `new_pullrequest` **repo1** **repo2**
```

Now, whenever any Issue that is assigned, or closed, or a `wontfix` label is added, or a new Pull Request is opened on the `repo1` or `repo2` repository will show up in this Column.


## Syntax

This bot uses normal Project Board note cards with Markdown formatting for configuration. 

### Automation Cards

- Automation Cards are identified by the string `###### Automation Rules` that _has_ to be used in the note text
- The automation card must be at any the top or bottom of a column (but they tend to end up at the bottom as new cards are added at the top automatically)
- There can be multiple automation cards per column, but you will probably not need that (unless you have _many_ rules or add items from _many_ repositories)
- An automation card can contain other text besides the headline and rules if you really need it to (but best avoid other lists to confuse the parser)

### Rules

- Rules have to be listed in an unnumbered list in the Automation Card
- This list can contain as many rules as you like
- The rule (see list below) _should_ to be wrapped in \` like so:
  ```
  - `example_rule`
  ```
- Rule Parameters _should_ be wrapped in `**` like so:
  ```
  - `example_rule` **param 1** **param 2**
  ```
- Items are added or moved into the column when _any_ of the rules in the list are triggered. (It is currently _not_ possible to use boolean logic to combine any rules.)

## Available Rules

The following rules can be included in automation cards:

## Add items

To add items to the project board, you have these two rules:

- `new_issue`: When an Issue is created (optionally, a space-separated set of repo names)
- `new_pullrequest`: When a Pull Request is created (optionally, a space-separated set of repo names)

## Move items

After an item has been added to a project board (manually or by the previous rules), it can be moved to another column by one of the following rules:

### Issues
- `edited_issue`: When an Issue is edited
- `assigned_issue`: When an Issue is assigned to a user (but was not before)
- `assigned_to_issue`: When an Issue is assigned to a specific user
- `unassigned_issue`: When an Issue is no longer assigned to a user
- `milestoned_issue`: When an Issue is added to a Milestone
- `demilestoned_issue`: When an Issue is removed from a Milestone
- `closed_issue`: When an Issue is closed
- `reopened_issue`: When an Issue is reopened

### Pull Requests
- `assigned_pullrequest`: When a Pull Request is assigned to a user (but was not before)
- `unassigned_pullrequest`: When a Pull Request is no longer assigned to a user
- `added_reviewer`: (optional username or array of usernames that need to be added)
- `accepted_pullrequest`: When at least one Reviewer Accepted, and there are no Rejections on a Pull request
- `merged_pullrequest`: When a Pull Request is merged
- `closed_pullrequest`: When a Pull Request is closed
- `reopened_pullrequest`: When a Pull Request is reopened

### Labels
- `added_label`: (requires exactly one argument, the string representing the name of the label)
- `removed_label`: (requires exactly one argument, the string representing the name of the label)

## Update items

To update items already on the project board, the following rules are available:

- `add_label`: (requires exactly one argument, the string representing the name of the label) Adds label to item moved to the column the rule is located
- `assign_issue_on_branch_create`: When a branch is created that starts with a valid number of an unassigned issue that's in a project with this rule listed, the issue is assigned to the branch creator. Note: because this rule does not move an item on a project board, the rule can be placed in any project column.

## Other

- Not finding the event you would like? Just create a new Issue in this Repository!
